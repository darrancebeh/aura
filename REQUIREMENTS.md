Project Aura: The On-Chain Transaction Inspector
1. Mission & Vision
Mission Statement: To build a command-line interface (CLI) tool that demystifies complex on-chain transactions, translating raw trace data into a human-readable, actionable summary for Web3 developers.
Vision: Aura aims to become an essential utility in the Web3 developer's toolkit, accelerating debugging and security analysis by providing unparalleled clarity into transaction execution flows.

2. Problem Statement
Developers and security analysts frequently need to understand the precise execution flow of a transaction. Existing block explorers present transaction traces as a deeply nested, raw list of calls that is cryptic and difficult to parse visually. This slows down debugging and makes it hard to spot anomalies. Aura solves this by focusing exclusively on developer-centric clarity and insight.

3. Core Functionality (MVP)
The Minimum Viable Product will be a CLI tool that accepts a transaction hash and outputs a human-readable summary of its execution.
Input: aura inspect <transaction_hash> --network <network_name>
Output: A chronological, color-coded, and indented list representing the transaction's call stack, including:
Decoded function calls (e.g., transfer(address, uint256)).
Decoded event logs.
Clear labeling of native ETH/currency transfers.

4. Technical Architecture
Language: Node.js (with TypeScript)
Key Libraries:
Ethers.js: For blockchain interaction.
Commander.js: For building the CLI interface.
Chalk: For color-coding terminal output.
External Services: An RPC provider with trace support (e.g., Alchemy, Infura).

5. High-Level Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation & Data Fetching. Set up the project and retrieve raw transaction trace data from an RPC node.
Phase 2: The Core Parser. Implement the logic to translate the raw trace into a structured, human-readable format.
Phase 3: UX & Interface Polish. Improve the CLI output with color-coding, indentation, and better error handling.
Phase 4: Documentation & Publication. Publish the tool to npm and create comprehensive documentation.
